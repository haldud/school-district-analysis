# School District Analysis
We have been analyzing high school students' performance in math and readingacross one district. There are two data sets that we have been given:
1. The first data set contains the list of high schools and various attributes such as type, size, and budget:

2. The second data set contains all of the unique high school students in the district along with their math and reading scores.

Throughout the module, we worked on ensuring that the data sets had complete and usable data to analyze properly. The complete code and analysis can be found in the [PyCitySchool](https://github.com/haldud/school-district-analysis/blob/a3d2a825774e48140607f5e16822f9cd211d3a30/PyCitySchools.ipynb) Jupiter Notebook file. We performed various analysis to determine some of the following:
- average math and reading scores
- % of students passing
- calculating per student budgets by school
- breaking out passing percentages by grade
- analyzing performance by budget per student
- analyzing performance by school size
- analyzing performance by school type (charter or district)

## Overview
For our challenge, we were given information that there was academic dishonesty, and that we needed to exclude all math and reading scores for 9th grade students at Thomas High School. We will be repeating the same analysis as we had done previously after clearing out all math and reading scores for those students. We will be comparing the new analsysi to our original to understand how excluding the 9th grade scores of Thomas High School affected our results.
